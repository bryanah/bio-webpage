	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<br>
	
	<br>
	<p>My favorite colors are red, black and white. I love to play volleyball and basketball. My favorite subjects are math and science. I'm 16 years old. My birthday is in November. I'm a Scorpio. I'm a cheerleader. I don't have a favorite food because I love to eat practically everything, but tell me to eat fish and I'll go crazy. I hate fish. My parents are extremely strict so I have to tell them practically EVERYTHING. I suck at Social Studies and will forget practically everything that I leanr within a day. I would like to say that I'm a gamer girl but I haven't touched a video game consol in over a month and honestly I feel a little deprived. My brother has all of the game systems in his room and he hogs them up for the majority of the day. my favorite games is Call of Duty and modern Warefare, don't ask me which one because I'll just look at you with a straight face and say all of them, and Battlefield. I don't really watch TV often, I'm more of a listen to music all of the time person. My favorite authors right now are Halsey and Melanie Martinez. My favorite movies are The Cronicles of Riddic, Pitch Black, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, the third Hunger Games (I forgot the name), The Pasifier, Fast and Furious (all of them basically) and there's a bunch more but I can't think of them right now. </p>
